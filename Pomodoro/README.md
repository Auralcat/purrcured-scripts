# Pomodoro

Pomodoro timer modules written in Python. The goal is to be as extensible
and integratable as possible. Choose where you want to use it and write
your own script using the modules in the *core* folder.

Additional features:

- Automatic task logging (all you need to do is write what task has been
  done)
- Tracks how many pomodoros you completed in a single day (all the data is
  in the .testdb file for further consultation)
